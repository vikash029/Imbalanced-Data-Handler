Imbalanced Data Handling in Machine Learning

üöÄ Overview

This project demonstrates how to handle imbalanced datasets using various resampling techniques, including:

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

Random Undersampling

Hybrid Methods (SMOTE + Tomek Links)

Class Weight Adjustments

The goal is to improve model performance on datasets with class imbalance, such as fraud detection, medical diagnoses, and anomaly detection.

Features


Data Resampling: Apply oversampling, undersampling, and hybrid techniques.

Model Training: Train a RandomForestClassifier with class weighting.

Performance Evaluation: Use Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

Visualization: Compare class distributions before and after resampling.


Results & Evaluation

The script will display classification reports and ROC-AUC scores.

It will also plot the original vs. resampled class distributions.
