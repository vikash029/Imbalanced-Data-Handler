Handling Imbalanced Data in Machine Learning

Overview
Class imbalance is prevalent in real-world problems such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection. This project presents several methods to handle class imbalance and enhance model performance.

Features
- Resampling Techniques:
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
  - Random Undersampling
  - Hybrid Approach (SMOTE + Tomek Links)
- Model Training:
- Trains machine learning algorithms on raw and balanced datasets
  - Employs Random Forest for classification
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Score
- Data Visualization:
  - Class distribution plots before and after balancing

Installation
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

   cd your-repo-name
```
```
2. Execute the Python script:
   ```bash
   python imbalance.py
   ```
